# Module 2

### Past cyber security attacks.
After understanding how an attack in history was executed we get an Idea of how it can be deployed in today's era

#### **Malware**

- Today Viruses are more commonly defined as malware
	
- They are Software designed to damage or harm the Devices or networks.
	
- The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.


**Common types:**
	1. Viruses
	2. Worms
	3. Ransom ware
	4. Spyware


*Viruses:*
- Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. Initiated by user, who transmits the virus via opening an attachment or clicking on link or download.  

*Worms:*
- Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.

*Ransomware:* 
- A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. 

 *Spyware:* 
 - Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.


**Two Examples**
	1. Brain virus
	2. Morris worm 

*Brain Virus*
- Alvi brothers created this in 1986
- Intention was to Track illegal copies of software and prevent pirated licenses.
- However, If someone download that pirated software, Virus would infect the System as well as any disk inserted into it. 
- This slowed down productivity and significantly affected business operations. 

*Morris Worm*
- Happened in 1988, Where Robert Morris created a program to assess size of the internet
- It crawled the web and connected itself to different computers connected over the internet. 
- The program however, Failed to keep tracks of the computers it had already compromised and re-installed itself until the computers ran out of memory and crashed.  
- 6000 computers were affected which were 10% of computers at the time.


#### **Phishing** 

 The technique to trick people into revealing their sensitive information or deploying malicious software. by acting like someone else.

Most common types of Phishing include:

- **Business email Compromise (BEC):** A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.
	
- **Spear phishing:** A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.
	
- **Whaling:** A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.
    
- **Vishing:** The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
    
- **Smishing:** The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

#### Social Engineering 

- Love letter attack was the first example of social engineering. 
- A manipulation technique that exploits the human error to gain private information, access or valuables. 
- Number of these attacks are increasing with every new social media which allows public access to people's data. 
- It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible.
	
- Types of Social engineering attacks may include
	- **Social media phishing:** A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.
	
	- **Watering hole attack:** A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
    
	- **USB baiting:** A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 
    
	- **Physical social engineering:** A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

##### Social Engineering Principles
Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

- **Authority:** Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures. 
    
- **Intimidation:** Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. 
    
- **Consensus/Social proof:** Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past. 
    
- **Scarcity:** A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. 
    
- **Familiarity:** Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.  
    
- **Trust:** Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited _over time_. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.
    
- **Urgency:** A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.



### Attacks in Digital age 
Threat actors no longer need Physical Disks to spread the viruses. 
Types example of attacks
- Love letter attack 
- Equifax breach. 


##### Love letter attack
- Known as `ILOVEYOU Virus`
- Created in year 2000s, TO steal login credentials 
- This was done by sending a email as a Love letter, After opening the attackment the malware installs into the device and scans the users address book. to retrive the username and password from each user
- It infected over 45millions computers with $10billion+ in damages. 
##### Equifax Breach
- Attackers in 2017 successfully infiltrated the credit reporting agency, Equifax.
- Resulted in one of the largest data breaches in history. 
- Over 147M customer records were stolen. 
- Affected approximately 40% Americans



One outcome of these attacks were that, new response teams were established. referred to as computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs)

They fall under asset security domain.


#### Adversarial artificial intelligence 

**Adversarial artificial intelligence** is a technique that manipulates [artificial intelligence and machine learning](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning) technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.


#### Supply chain attacks

A **supply-chain attack** targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.


#### Cryptographic attack

A **cryptographic attack** affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

- Birthday
    
- Collision
    
- Downgrade
    

Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain




### Threat actors Types


#### **Advanced persistent threats**

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources
    
- Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents


#### Insider threats

Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: 

- Sabotage
    
- Corruption
    
- Espionage
    
- Unauthorized data access or leaks


#### Hacktivists 

Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: 

- Demonstrations
    
- Propaganda
    
- Social change campaigns
    
- Fame


> **Hacker types**

A **hacker** is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

- Authorized hackers are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.
    
- Semi-authorized hackers are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.
    
- Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain.




# Module 3

## Framework, Controls and ethics


#### **Security Frameworks**

- Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy 
- Provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. 
- Security lifecycle is constantly evolving set of principles, that define how organization manages risks. Follow guidelines and meet Regulatory compliance and law. 
- Purpose:
	- Protecting Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
	- Securing Financial information
	- Indentifying security weaknesses 
	- Managing Organizational risks
- Components:
	- Identifying and documenting Security goals
	- Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
	- Implementing strong security processes
	- Monitoring and communicating results

>**Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.

#### **Security controls**
- Designed to reduce specific security risks
- they are used alongside frameworks to ensure that security goals and processes are implemented correctly

#### Some Actual Frameworks 

##### CIA Triad
- Stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability 
- A foundational model that helps inform how organization consider risks when setting up systems and security policies. 


##### NIST CSF
- National Institute of Standards and Technology's cybersecurity Framework. {A U.S based agency}
- A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risks. 
- Baseline to manage short and long term risks


##### **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. For example, if an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an E.U. citizen and why they are holding that data, this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed. The affected organization has 72 hours to notify the E.U. citizen about the breach.


##### **Center for Internet Security (CIS®)**
- CIS is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks. Its purpose is to help organizations establish a better plan of defense. CIS also provides actionable controls that security professionals may follow if a security incident occurs.


##### **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**
- PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. The objective of this compliance standard is to reduce credit card fraud.


##### **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** 
- ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders. It helps organizations improve their processes and procedures for staff retention, planning, waste, and services.


##### **The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**

- HIPAA is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. It is governed by three rules: 

1. Privacy
    
2. Security 
    
3. Breach notification 
    

- Organizations that store patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach because if patients' **Protected Health Information** (PHI) is exposed, it can lead to identity theft and insurance fraud. PHI relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, whether it’s a plan of care or payments for care. Along with understanding HIPAA as a law, security professionals also need to be familiar with the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®), which is a security framework and assurance program that helps institutions meet HIPAA compliance.



##### **System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)**

- The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants® (AICPA) auditing standards board developed this standard. The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels such as: 

- Associate
    
- Supervisor
    
- Manager
    
- Executive
    
- Vendor
    
- Others 
    

- They are used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.
